# Social Network Kata
Inspired by [Sandro Mancuso & Samir Talwar](http://monospacedmonologues.com/post/49250842364/the-social-networking-kata)

Your Team is tired of all those boring tasks like bowling game scores, bank accounts, singing songs or commanding mars rovers. This time you want to do something truly innovative: A Social Network!

Your team also decided for this project to not only apply TDD and pair-programming - this time you’re gonna use BDD to cover all important features.
